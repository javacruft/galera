 Upgrading Galera Cluster for MySQL
====================================
.. _`Upgrading Galera Cluster for MySQL`:

This chapter describes three different ways to upgrade Galera Cluster. 

---------------
Rolling Upgrade
---------------
.. _`Rolling Upgrade`:

You can carry out a rolling upgrade on a Galera Cluster by applying the following steps on each cluster node:

.. note:: Transfer all clients connections from the node to be upgraded to the other nodes for the time of migration.

1. Shutdown the node

2. Upgrade the software

3. Restart the node

4. Wait until the node gets synchronized with the cluster

.. tip:: If the upgraded node has been or will be part of a weighted quorum, set the initial node weight to zero.  In this way, it can be guaranteed that if the joining node fails before it gets synchronized, it does not have effect in the quorum computation that follows. 

The main advantage of a rolling upgrade is that if something goes wrong with the upgrade, the other nodes are still operational and you have time to troubleshoot the problem.

However, rolling upgrade has some issues which deserve consideration:

- Upgrading an individual node can take some time, during which the cluster operates at a lower capacity:
  
  - Unless incremental state transfer is used, the node resorts to full state snapshot transfer, which can take a long time depending on the database size and state transfer method.
  
  - During that time, the node will accumulate a very long catch-up replication event queue, which it will have to replay to get synchronized with the cluster. At the same time, the cluster adds more and more events to the queue.

- Unless ``xtrabackup`` or ``rsync`` with LVM state transfer methods are used, the state snapshot donor node will be also blocked for the duration of the state transfer. Xtrabackup or rsync+LVM state transfer do not block the donor, but may slow it down. In practice, the cluster will lack 2 nodes for the duration of state transfer and 1 node for the duration of the catch-up phase.

- If there are few nodes in the cluster and it operates close to its maximum capacity, taking out 2 nodes can lead to a situation where the cluster cannot serve all requests, or execution times may increase, making the service less available.

- If there are several nodes in the cluster, it would take a long time to upgrade the whole cluster.

- Depending on the load balancing mechanism, you may have to instruct the load balancer not to direct requests to the joining and donating nodes.

- Every time a new node is joining a cluster, cluster performance drops until the node buffer pool warms up. Parallel applying helps in this.

Bulk Upgrade
------------
.. _`Bulk Upgrade`:

A bulk upgrade upgrades all nodes in an idle cluster to avoid time-consuming state transfers. Bulk upgrade produces a short but complete service outage. You can carry out a bulk upgrade on a Galera Cluster as follows:

1. Stop all load on the cluster

2. Shut down all the nodes

3. Upgrade software

4. Restart the nodes. The nodes will merge to the cluster without state transfers, in a matter of seconds.

5. Resume the load on the cluster

.. note:: You can carry out steps 2-3-4 on all nodes in parallel, therefore reducing the service outage time to virtually the time needed for a single server restart.

.. warning:: Always use this method for a two-node cluster upgrade, as the rolling upgrade would result in a much longer service outage.
 
The main advantage of the bulk upgrade is that, for huge databases, it is faster and results in better availability than the rolling upgrade.  The main drawback of the bulk upgrade is that it relies on the upgrade and the restart will be quick. However shutting down an InnoDB may take up a few minutes (as it flushes dirty pages), and if something goes wrong during the upgrade, there is hardly any time to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Therefore, do not upgrade all nodes at once, but try it first on a single node.


---------------------
Provider-only Upgrade
---------------------
.. _`Provider-only Upgrade`:

.. index::
   pair: Parameters; wsrep_cluster_address

If only a Galera provider upgrade is required, the bulk upgrade can be further optimized to only take a few seconds. The following is an example for a 64-bit CentOS (or RHEL):

1. Issue the commands below on every node:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ rpm -e galera
    $ rpm -i <new galera rpm>

2. Stop all load on the cluster.

3. Issue the query below on every node:

   .. code-block:: mysql

    SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider='none';
    SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider='/usr/lib64/galera/libgalera_smm.so';

4. Issue the query below on node 1 (or any node):

   .. code-block:: mysql

    SET GLOBAL wsrep_cluster_address='gcomm://';

5. Issue the query below on the other nodes:

   .. code-block:: mysql

    SET GLOBAL wsrep_cluster_address='gcomm://node1';
    
6. Resume the load on the cluster.

Reloading the provider and connecting to the cluster takes typically less than 10 seconds; there is virtually no service outage. 

.. important:: In the provider-only upgrade, the warmed up InnoDB buffer pool is fully preserved and the cluster will continue to operate at full speed as soon as the load is resumed.
