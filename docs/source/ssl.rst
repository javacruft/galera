Galera Cluster supports :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` for the encryption of replication traffic. Authentication is not supported. SSL is a cluster-wide option and must be enabled either on all of the nodes or none at all. 

To use SSL, you must generate a private certificate/key pair for the cluster, for example, by the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365000 \
    	-nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

.. note:: It is crucial to generate a certificate/key pair, which is valid for a long time. When the certificate expires, there will be no way to update the cluster without complete shutdown. Thus, use a large value for the the ``-days`` parameter.

Copy this certificate/key pair to the ``/etc/mysql`` directory on all of the nodes. Copy the files over a secure channel between the nodes.

Take the certificate/key pair to use by specifying the following Galera Cluster options:

.. code-block:: ini

    socket.ssl_cert = /path/to/cert-file
    socket.ssl_key = /path/to/key-file

Other SSL configuration parameters include ``socket.ssl_compression`` and ``socket.ssl_cipher``. See :ref:`Galera Parameters <Galera Parameters>` for details.

.. note:: You cannot use a mixed cluster where some nodes have SSL and some do not. We recommend configuring SSL when you are setting up a new cluster. If you must add SSL support on a production system, you must rebootstrap the cluster and accept a brief outage.

.. warning:: The Galera Cluster SSL support only covers Galera Cluster communication. Since state snapshot transfer happens outside of Galera Cluster, protect it separately.  You can use, for example, the internal SSL support in the MySQL client or the ``stunnel`` program to protect ``rsync`` traffic.
